# Checkpoint 2 Submission: Veilwalker – Recovering the Memory Beneath the Canopy

## 🔮 Vision

Veilwalker is a symbolic and technical framework for uncovering ancient Amazonian sites using AI-assisted pattern recognition, GPT-based myth parsing, and terrain modeling. We approach archaeological discovery not just as data science, but as memory restoration—aligning ancient symbolic structures with modern tooling.

## 🔧 Setup Complete

- Public GitHub repo (licensed under CC0): https://github.com/wealthyelephant/veilwalker
- Fully structured project skeleton (data, scripts, writeup, models, etc.)
- OpenAI GPT-4.1 integrated into pipeline planning
- “Five Veils” framework constructed to guide symbolic understanding of each discovery layer (Flood, Jungle, Desert, Ice, Aether)

## 🧠 OpenAI Use

We plan to use GPT-4.1 to:
- Extract spatial and symbolic clues from expedition diaries and oral stories
- Correlate indigenous cosmology with LiDAR-based terrain anomalies
- Develop a symbolic signature matcher that merges narrative + geometry

## 🗺 What Comes Next

- Ingest first LiDAR tile + canopy-stripped terrain model
- Apply NDVI and vegetation scar analysis via Sentinel-2
- Generate a myth-pattern prompt set for AI-guided location targeting
- Identify candidate coordinates for final submission
